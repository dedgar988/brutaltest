## Orpheus and Eurydice

The deer lies heavily across my shoulders, but my step is lightened by the thought of my wife's smile.   I keep striding, thoughts turning to future happiness, until I sight our little cottage on the hill.   The sun beams pleasantly, and my thoughts return to an evening barbeque.  It's going to be a night to remember.    My musings are interrupted by a chill breeze,  carrying a note of panic and the rhythm of my name.  Oooorpheeeeus.   I recognise the voice.  It is my Wife's.  I drop the deer and run.

The shout seemed to come from past the pond, near the tree. I usually sit upon this tree to sing each night and cast my protection upon this place. Yesterday, I had not done so. I had spent the day hunting, with little to show, and the following day I was expecting to go out again.   Eurydice had quietly smiled, and sent me off to bed, her eyes speaking understanding. She had accepted my promise of a song tomorrow. 

Underneath the tree I see a figure Moving closer;  I see eyes that speak no more. Closer still; a bloody wrist marked with the teeth of a snake.  I move her hair to frame her face.  For a moment, I believe I see a breath, I stand still.   When I blink again the sun has moved far across the sky. I close her eyes, drop to my knees and weep.

My heart is broken, my mind shattered, but inside me I still have my song.  A rhythm alone, its drumming beat pushes me forward.   I knew the way to the world of the dead.  On my past adventures I'd discovered much.   I pick up my lyre and stride.  I strum my way past those who block my path.  There are few who can resist a song of mine.   Although, that might be tested in my destination.  The world of the dead. 

I hear the flow of water in the Styx, surprisingly gentle for a river that marks the boundary between living and dead.  It almost looks a peaceful place to sit and dip your toes.  I head to the one small lamp, which outlines the small canoe and it's owner crouched within.  Charon.  I step closer, until I can see his eyes, misted and grey with their time spent ferrying the dead. I play.   A song of Eurydice and I, just a day after our marriage, returning to our lives together.   The ship carrying us swiftly through the water.  Our friends around us laughing and joking, safe after our adventure.  The curl of her smile, as she looks at me with the sun behind her.  I do not know, which was brighter.  I see a blue begin to emerge in Charon's eyes.  I step in the boat.  He begins to row.  No words are spoken.

We reach the shore. I see the great dog Cerberus, its three heads, teeth bared all focused on me. I add a new melody to my song. I tell the tale of my wife and a young pup. Tiny and abandoned by it's mother as a weakling. Taken in by my wife. Given strength by her hand. Faithfully guarding the villages sheep for years on end. Until, a night of storms that drowned out the sound of even my music. A flood that caused most animals to flee the area. A few weeks later, a dawn where wolves, driven by hunger, attacked the herd in their stable. Most of the sheep survived, but the dog did not. It breathed its last breath calmly, as my wife's hand smoothed it's bloody head. A life well lived. The fitting end strikes the right with Cerberus.  He sits.  I move on.

Hades and Prosperina, the king and queen of the underworld, stand in front of me.  I can see tears glitter on the edge of the queens eyes.  The King's face remains calm.  The system is what rules here.  However, rules can be bent by feelings, and I know the Queen's past.  I begin a new melody.  I tell of hopes and dreams, whispered conversations of the future.  Of children.  Of laughter.  Of sharing an old age.  A song of possibility,  seldom heard in a place marked by endlessly shuffling souls.  The ghosts perhaps occasionally remember dreams, but never create realities.  But, the Queen remembers.  She remembers her mother, her family.  She remembers the possibilities of her life before the world of the dead.  Tears pour down her face.  Hades sees.  He knows I have brought a threat to his order.   He nods, smiling with his mouth though not with his eyes, and offers me a deal.

'The soul of Eurydice will be allowed to return. She will follow you back to the land of the living. However, you may not look upon her, until you stand on ground outside the realm of the dead. Turn from us now. She will be behind you.' I conclude the song. I begin to run. I do not know for how long I played my song. I did not feel the time. For this run however, on every step I feel the seconds. I had played about possibilities and possibilities plague me. I could not see her, hear hear, smell her, feel her. Was she there? I think about my breathing, trying to wish away the thoughts. For a time it works. I feel my lungs, my feet, my heart, but not it's deeper parts. I see a ray of light. I am close. I can see our future again in my mind. Our songs, our house, our children. I want to know it's true. I turn. I look.

I see the soft curl of her smile. The forgiveness in her eyes. She vanishes. I have my certainty. It is hollow.
